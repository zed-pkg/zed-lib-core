# Admin ORM boundary

This package is the named administrative database surface owned by
`zed-lib-core`. The sibling admin API and admin web server import it through the
repository's Zed coordinate and compile this Rust package from the same reviewed
revision.

The web server receives only `AdminReadContext`, which rejects a credential
unless PostgreSQL reports `transaction_read_only=on`. The API receives
`AdminWriteContext`, which rejects a read-only credential. Neither context
exposes its SeaORM connection, and consumers cannot submit arbitrary SQL.

Schema and migration authority remains with the product lib-core. This package
performs only the named readiness, grant, dashboard, and idempotent action
operations required by the isolated admin plane; it never runs migrations.
